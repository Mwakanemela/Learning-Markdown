# Headings
#heading 1, ##heading 2, ###heading 3 ####heading 4 upto 6 - just like headings in html

# Text Styling
**This** is __bold__
<br/>
*This* is _italic_
<br/>
<span>I can also use <b>HTML</b> in md</span>

Used a hard break line (press enter twice to create to diff sentences)   
For this I used a soft beak line (by double clicking on the space bar)
